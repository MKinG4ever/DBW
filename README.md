# Why we're using python:

Python is chosen as the core programming language for several reasons. Firstly, Python's simplicity and readability make
it highly accessible, allowing developers to write clean and maintainable code. Additionally, Python boasts a vast
ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it versatile for a wide range of applications, including web development,
data analysis, machine learning, and more. Its extensive standard library provides robust support for various tasks
without the need for external dependencies. Furthermore, Python's interpreted nature facilitates rapid development and
prototyping, enabling faster iteration cycles and time-to-market for projects. Overall, Python's combination of ease of
use, versatility, and community support makes it an excellent choice for developing web applications like the one in
this project.
